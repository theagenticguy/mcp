# Common Issues when Generating Code

- Routing - always the already installed react-router v7 for routing. Do not use the outdated react-router-dom package
- Components - always look for existing shadcn components before attempting to create new custom components
- Copying/Moving files - the user might be on Windows, try cross-platform commands
- Generating Images - a minimum resolution of 320x320 is required for Nova Canvas MCP server to generate images
