When creating new pages, components, or UI elements, always check if there is a shadcn component that can be used instead of creating custom components. 

This will improve the maintainability of the application and simplify the codebase

Install shadcn/ui components as needed. You must use the --force flag to avoid dependency issues

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```
